0x00 C Initialize the stack pointer
0x03 S Zero VRAM from 0x9fff down to 0x8000
0x07 L clear_vram
0x08 C Set the Z flag if the Most Significant Bit of H (and HL) is unset, signaling that HL is past 0x8000 into 0x7fff
0x0a G clear_vram
0x0c S Audio configuration
0x13 C Set 0x80 at address 0xff26  (Turn the Audio Processing Unit on)
0x14 C Set value 0x80 at 0xFF11 (Configure Channel 1 Sound length/Wave pattern duty)
0x18 C Set value 0xf3 at 0xFF12 (Configure Channel 1 Volume Envelope)
0x19 C Set value 0xf3 at 0xFF25 (Selection of Sound output terminal (R/W))
0x1c C Set value 0x77 at 0xFF24 (Channel control / ON-OFF / Volume (R/W))
0x1d S Setting the Palette
0x1f C Set value 0xfc at 0xFF47 (BGP - BG Palette Data (R/W) - Idx 0 is white, others are black)
0x21 S Uncompressing the nintendo logo from the cartridge into VRAM
0x21 C 0x0104 address of the beginning of the Nintendo logo in the cartridge
0x24 C 0x8010 VRAM
0x27 C Load the first character of the logo into A
0x28 G decode_byte_first_half
0x29 G decode_byte_second_half
0x2b D 0x6a
0x95 L decode_byte_first_half
0x95 C Reset C to the compressed value
0x96 L decode_byte_second_half
0x96 C Number of bits to extract from C into A
0x98 L next_bit
0x98 C Save B and C
0x99 C Take most significant bit of C into carry
0x9b C Move carry into the Least significant bit of A
0x9c C Restore B and C (bring back MSB of C)
0x9d C Do again as before
0x9f C Now the MSB of C is doubled into A
0xa1 C Duplicate the next bit in C into A (until we have done this block of 4 and B is 0)
0xa3 C Copy the decompressed byte into RAM twice (A skip A skip ? why skip both?)
0xa1 G next_bit
