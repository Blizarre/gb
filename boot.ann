0x1f C Set value 0xfc at 0xFF47 (BGP - BG Palette Data (R/W) - Idx 0 is white, others are black)
0x21 S Uncompressing the nintendo logo from the cartridge into VRAM
0x21 C 0x0104 address of the beginning of the Nintendo logo in the cartridge
0x24 C 0x8010 VRAM
0x27 L uncompress_logo
0x27 C Load the current character of the logo into A
0x28 C Decode the first 4 bits of the current logo byte into VRAM
0x28 G decode_byte_first_half
0x2b C Decode the last 4 bits of the current logo byte into VRAM
0x2b G decode_byte_second_half
0x2e C Move on to the next byte

0x95 L decode_byte_first_half
0x95 C Reset C to the compressed value
0x96 L decode_byte_second_half
0x96 C Number of bits to extract from C into A
0x98 L next_bit
0x98 C Save B and C
0x99 C Take most significant bit of C into carry
0x9b C Move carry into the Least significant bit of A
0x9c C Restore B and C (bring back MSB of C)
0x9d C Do again as before
0x9f C Now the MSB of C is doubled into A
0xa1 C Duplicate the next bit in C into A (until we have done this block of 4 and B is 0)
0xa3 C Copy the decompressed byte into RAM twice (A skip A skip ? why skip both?)
0xa1 G next_bit
